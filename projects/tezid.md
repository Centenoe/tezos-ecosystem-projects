TezID allows users to prove that they own certain digital property such as an email address, phone number, etc. TezID also supports a full fledged KYC solution for Tezos projects. TezID puts user security and safety first, and all data stored (unless explicitly allowed by the user) is securely hashed so that not even we can decrypt it. The "proofs" issued by TezID can be used for KYC, quadrativ funding, quadratic voting, bot prevention, whitelisting, and more.
